# Hi, I'm Brad 👋

**Principal Software Engineer | Cloud Architect | DevOps Leader**

I'm a hands-on engineering leader with **17+ years** of experience building, modernizing, and scaling enterprise software platforms. I specialize in cloud-native architecture and DevOps - helping organizations migrate to the cloud, containerize legacy workloads, and ship faster with confidence.

---

### What I Do

- **Cloud Migration & Modernization** - I lead teams that decouple monoliths, containerize applications, and migrate them to AWS (EKS, ECS, RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB) as part of large-scale data center exits and platform transformations.
- **DevOps & Platform Engineering** - I design and build CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK), and developer platforms that help engineering teams move quickly and safely.
- **Consulting & Technical Leadership** - As a consultant, I've delivered cloud solutions for Fortune 500 companies across fintech, real estate, edtech, energy, and financial services - from architecture assessments to hands-on implementation.
